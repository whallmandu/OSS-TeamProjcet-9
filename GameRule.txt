Survivor’s Choice – Game Rules
30-Day Deserted Island Survival Simulation Game
Language: C

#1. Game Overview :
This game is a 30-day survival game set on an uninhabited island.
The player encounters one event per day and must choose how to act.
Each decision affects the player’s survival stats and may influence branching paths and multiple endings.
The core goal is :
Survive until Day 30.
Your choices determine whether you escape, die, or uncover secret endings.




#2. Player Stats :
The player’s condition is represented through three core stats ->
HP (Health): If HP reaches 0 → Game Over
Hunger: Affects condition over time, reduced by eating
Thirst: Must be managed daily, reduced by drinking water
These stats appear at the start of every event:
==============================
Day X //(X is Realnumeber)
[HP: ##] [Hunger: ##] [Thirst: ##]
==============================




#3. Daily Event Structure :
Each day, one event is triggered.
Events are categorized as:
-Normal Events (common daily situations)
-Rare Events (low-probability special events)
-Fixed Events (appear only under certain conditions)
Every event follows the same structure:
1 Day & player stats displayed
2 Event text appears (English + Korean for actual game)
3 Player chooses from available options
4 Stats or items change based on the result
5 Move to next day




#4. Choice System
Each event provides three main choices:
1: Check resources
Displays current item inventory. Does not progress the event.
2~n: Situation-specific actions
Hunting, eating, resting, exploring, etc.
0: Quit
Used for exiting debugging or terminating an event early.
Some choices are marked as risky, meaning they can result in random success or failure through rand().
Example of risky outcomes:
Success → gain food/water/items, or restore HP
Failure → lose HP, lose items, or miss opportunities
Certain choices appear only under item or stat conditions
(e.g., rope ≥ 1, wood ≥ 10, etc.).




#5. Example In-Game Event (Code & Interface)
Below is a short example showing how an event works.
int event_tree_hole(players *player) {
    printf("==============================\n");
    printf("Day %d\n", player->Day);
    printf("[HP: %d] [Hunger: %d] [Thirst: %d]\n",
           player->HP, player->Hunger, player->Thirst);
    printf("==============================\n\n");

    printf("You find a large tree with a hole in its trunk.\n");

    int n;
    while (1) {
        printf("[1: Check resources] [2: Put your hand inside] [3: Walk past] [0: Quit]\n");
        if (scanf("%d",&n)!=1){while(getchar()!='\n');continue;}
        if(n==1) checkR();
        else if(n==2||n==3||n==0) break;
        else printf("wrong input!\n");
    }

    if (n==0) return 4;

    if (n==2) {
        int r = rand()%2;
        if (r==0) { player->HP -=10; printf("[HP -10]\n"); }
        else      { item[1].count +=1; printf("[food +1]\n"); }
    }
    else printf("You walk past the tree.\n");

    return 0;
}
What the Player Sees
==============================
Day 7
[HP: 62] [Hunger: 30] [Thirst: 41]
==============================

You find a large tree with a hole in its trunk.

[1: Check resources] 
[2: Put your hand inside (risky)] 
[3: Walk past] 
[0: Quit]

==POSSIBLE RESULTS==
Success -> "You find eggs.' -> food +1 ;
Failure -> "A bird pecks you!" -> HP -10;
This example represents the basic structure of all events.



#6. Items and Resource Management :
Throughout the game, the player collects:
Food → restores Hunger
Water → restores Thirst
Wood → used for crafting
Leaves → shelter or rope crafting
Rope → triggers certain special events
Resources are essential for navigating choices and unlocking events.



#7. Endings :
The game features multiple endings, influenced by:
Final stats
Player decisions
Key items obtained
Hidden conditions and rare events
Possible outcomes include:
Successful Rescue (Good Ending)
Neutral Escape / Barely Survived
Bad Ending (death from HP, dehydration, starvation)
Secret Endings (item-dependent or route-dependent)




#8. Additional Notes :
The game is purely text-based (console interface).
All text is written in English in the code, with Korean variants in design documents.
Player input is always numeric.
Any non-numeric input resets the prompt.
Random results use rand(), so outcomes vary each playthrough.
