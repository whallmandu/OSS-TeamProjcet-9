Welcome to a challenging 30-day survival experience on a deserted island. The fundamental flow of the game is based on day-by-day progression and critical decision-making.

-RULES-
30-Day Cycle: The game spans exactly 30 days. You must survive until the end to see your result.
Daily Choices: Each day, you will be presented with one or more immediate situations requiring action. Typically, you will have two distinct choices for each situation.
Multi-Ending System: Your accumulated choices and resulting character stats will determine which of the Multiple Endings you unlock, ranging from successful rescue to a tragic outcome.
Special Events: The game features Special Events (특수 상황)—unique, high-impact scenarios that occur randomly or under specific conditions, forcing difficult trade-offs.

-CODE EXAMPLES AND INTERFACE EXPLANATION-
The game's progression is driven by the logic behind your daily choices. 
Below is a simplified, representative code snippet that models a daily decision, followed by an explanation of the player interface for that moment.

FIXED EVENT :
int day1Event(players *player) { //first day
    printf("==============================\n");
    printf("Day %d\n", player->Day); //Day data
    printf("[HP: %d] [Hunger: %d] [Thirst: %d] [Fatigue: %d]\n", player->HP, player->Hunger, player->Thirst, player->Fatigue); //player data
    printf("==============================\n\n");
    
    printf("First day.\n"); //text data(story)

    int n;
    while(1) {
        printf("[1: Check resources] [2: Go seashore] [0: Quit]\n"); //selections
        
        //data input
        scanf("%d", &n);
        if(n==1) checkR();
        else if(n==2) break;
        else if(n==0) return 4; //this is 'Quit' return data. only 4.
        else printf("wrong input\n");
    }

    if(n==2) { //Go seashore
        int r = rand()%2; //random
        if(r==1) { //wood
            printf("==============================\n");
            printf("You find wood!\n");
            printf("[wood +3]\n");
            printf("==============================\n");
            item[3].count += 3; //item update
        } else { //food
            printf("==============================\n");
            printf("You find food\n");
            printf("[food +1]\n");
            printf("==============================\n");
            item[1].count++; //item update
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

SITUATION : The First Day of the Game.
CHOICES : 1: Check resources], [2: Go seashore], [0: Quit].
Result : Choosing 'Go seashore' grants a 50% chance to find Wood +3, or a 50% chance to find Food +1.
